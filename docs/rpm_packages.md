# MicroShift RPM Packages for Development and Testing

MicroShift RPM development packages are intended to be used internally at Red Hat to facilitate the development and QE processes, **never** to be distributed to customers. The packages are produced every time a corresponding OpenShift nightly build is successful.

> For more information, see the `MicroShift Pre-Release RPM Packages` internal Red Hat Confluence page.
